# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
- I helped a group push their final project app onto Heroku (I am a TA at Wyncode Academy) 
- Working my way through Part 3 of this tutorial: https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/evil-front-part-3
- My goal is to finish this tutorial

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to focus on the tutorial, because of the students asking for help, but heroku-wise, we fixed an asset issue (make sure `font-size` has a dash in between! Heroku does not like CSS errors!), made sure the Gemfile only had 1 development block and 1 production block, and pushed successfully!

### Day 1: December 30, 2017, Saturday

** Today's Progress** :
- I worked on the `frontend-chat` tutorial and pushed to heroku successfully

**Thoughts:** Learned how Rails works with Webpacker

**Link to work:** [frontend-chat](https://frontend-chat.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 2: December 31, 2017, Sunday

** Today's Progress** :
- I finished the `frontend-chat` and also learned how to use static assets, as well as re-enable
Turbolinks, as well as get around not using Sprockets

**Thoughts:** I built a front end chat all with Rails!

### Day 3: January 1, 2018, Monday

** Today's Progress** :
- Working my way through freeCodeCamp courses. Still on HTML5/CSS, but it's good to reinforce what I already know.

**Thoughts:** Today is more of a relaxing day for coding!

### Day 4: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Worked on more freeCodeCamp exercises.
- Nerded out over code with a few people.

**Thoughts:** It is good to keep reinforcing the skills I already know. However, new things keep sinking in as well!

### Day 5: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Learned about Services in Rails
- Answered technical questions for a potential job

**Thoughts:** Being unemployed is very scary, but learning more things keeps me going!

### Day 6: January 4, 2018, Thursday

** Today's Progress** :
- Finished answering technical questions with a potential employer
- Fixing bugs in a Rails app for another potential employer

**Thoughts:** Being able to complete these challenges confirms that I actually know some things and have improved, these past 2 years! What a good feeling!

### Day 7: January 5, 2018, Friday

** Today's Progress** :
- TAed at Wyncode and helped a student set up Rails on their new MacBook
- Helped another student model their data for an upcoming project
- Learned about GitLab Workhorse

**Thoughts:** Cohort 20 left me a "thank you" note for TAing their cohort. Very cool! 

### Day 8: January 6, 2018, Saturday

** Today's Progress** :
- Applied for more jobs
- More freeCodeCamp front end fun!

**Thoughts:** Even though I am always reading about code or programmers or programming, it is good to take a break from time to time. Balance is everything. That being said, I'm having a blast understanding front end better and better!!

### Day 9: January 7, 2018, Sunday

** Today's Progress** :
- Understanding how things tie in, better than before!
- Went through more freeCodeCamp exercises. Working through jQuery selectors.

**Thoughts:** When I started to learn all of this, over 2 years ago, I had to take extensive notes and really try to wrap my brain around it all. Now, it seems like second nature; it is purely reinforcing!! Yay!

### Day 10: January 8, 2018, Monday

** Today's Progress** :
- TAed at Wyncode. Helped a student push to production/Heroku
- Figured out that another student was deleting items from the database (had bad data)
- Taught a student the decent_exposure gem. 

**Thoughts:** The first student had operating system/Ruby Version issues. We resolved it by using rbenv.

### Day 11: January 9, 2018, Tuesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Making my way through the freeCodeCamp jQuery lessons. 

**Thoughts:** I remember, before attending Wyncode (over 2 years ago), learning about jQuery and understanding and liking it. 

### Day 12: January 10, 2018, Wednesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Working on personal project (Rails). Need to hook up the OMDB Api and get it to work in app.
- Answering more technical questions for jobs.
- TAing at Wyncode, helping students with forking/cloning on GitHub and their Rails projects.

**Thoughts:** Looking for a job is frustrating, but I'm trying to take things one step at a time, always moving forward and learning.

### Day 13: January 11, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress** :
- Worked on a blockchain tutorial (in JavaScript and Ruby)

**Thoughts:** It was interesting to learn that if one block is changes, all subsequent blocks would need to be changed.

### Day 14: January 12, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress** :
- Successfully routed buttons in my moviesiveseen Rails project (personal project) and have all of the CRUD operations working. Need to style.
- Background image on homepage was not showing in production (Heroku). Figured that out by adding a few lines in config
- Styled the welcome page in CSS, instead of in the assets/javascript file (unnecessary!)
- Will TA at Wyncode for a few hours today!

**Thoughts:** It feels GOOD to be making some progress on this project. 

### Day 15: January 13, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**:
- Worked on the personal project, adding image uploading and authorization!
- Coded with a friend. She made me aware of accessibility for font colors, etc

**Thoughts:** Making more progress! Image uploading was so difficult, before, but it makes more sense now!

### Day 16: January 14, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**:
- Working on image feature in movie Rails app
- Works on styling Welcome page. Had fun playing with fonts!

**Thoughts:** Making progress builds confidence. Solving certain issues makes more sense than it did a year ago. Progress!

### Day 17: January 15, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**:
- TAed at Wyncode for 5 hours, helping students with their REPL games (in Ruby). Taught some students the beauty of using methods (and where/when to call them).
- Helped describe the difference between returning an object, in Rails, compared to calling an attribute on that object (which is what he wanted)

**Thoughts:** It is always fun to witness the moment when things click with a student

### Day 18: January 16, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Partially designed index page. It's looking so cool!!! 
- Had a job interview with a screenshare - had to make tests pass (I did), and explain the code I changed and why (I felt like it went well)

**Thoughts:** It's nice to build a project I will feel proud to show others

### Day 19: January 17, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Let a breakout session at Wyncode about Classes and Methods
- The border around my images changes when the screen size changes - need to figure this out! (Rails app)

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel depressed about the job situation. Got another rejection.

### Day 20: January 18, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**:
- Both the Welcome page and the Index page are responsive on all devices!
- Need to figure out image size on heroku (significantly smaller than on local)
- Had another interview (went well - will get coding challenge)

**Thoughts:** Coding makes me happy. I can lose myself in it, and know that this is the "right" path for me. It felt so good to make the 2 pages responsive!

### Day 21: January 19, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**:
- Figured out a solution to one of the coding challenges given for a job!
- Need to figure out the ReactJS part

**Thoughts:** I know I am competent, and just need to prove it to others in order to make a living in this field, again!

### Day 22: January 20, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**:
- Pretty much figured out the Rails side of things for this coding challenge.
- Trying to integrate React components to make this a SPA. Having trouble getting the framework to recognize the view/components (returning json, instead)

**Thoughts:** I am so close to finishing this challenge! It feels good that I'm "doing it". Once I figure out how to get the API to read the React components, I'll be in business.

### Day 23: January 21, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**:
- Figured out how to render my components in the DOM
- Wired in the Index, Show, Edit and Delete functions
- Edit, now, requires that all fields are filled in, or else it will save it as null. Need to fix that
- Need to do the Create!

**Thoughts:** I can not believe I am figuring all of this stuff out on my own!!! I hope I get a job offer soon!

### Day 24: January 22, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**:
- Successfully created all CRUD actions to the SPA/React front! I can DELETE a Post, CREATE a Post, EDIT, and view all of the active ones!

**Thoughts:** Just a few months ago, I would not have been able to build this on my own. I have literally not asked anyone for help, thus far!! (Besides Google)

### Day 25: January 23, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Finished abstracting the factorial function from the backend to the client-side. Got it to work in the Update and Create methods!
- Turned in that coding challenge
- Got a trial offer to work for a week or 2 at a startup in Brickell

**Thoughts:** I will take the trial, and hopefully hear back from the coding challenge job as well. Always learning and moving forward! Today was a very productive REACT day!

### Day 26: January 24, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Pushed the massive coding challenge to GitHub
- Attending an "Add Redux to your React App" meetup tonight!
- TAed at Wyncode (did 2 one-on-ones. Challenge was about running RSpecs and building a Card class)

**Thoughts:**
- I got rejected from the remote job, but still feel pretty good! The CTO said that I "impressed him" and would keep me in mind for the future. I feel so good that I was able to do the challenge all by myself! Rails AND React!

### Day 27: January 25, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**:
- Honestly did not do much. Went over a bit of Redux from the meetup last night

**Thoughts:**
- Sometimes you need a break to let things sink in.

### Day 28: January 26, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**:
- Working on a challenge in Python! 
- Figured out how to install pip (I vaguely remember this from a Meetup I went to in Chicago, about 3 years ago)
- Was able to run the script and view the data. Now, to tackle the challenge!
- TAed at Wyncode. Helped someone with their JavaScript datepicker; got it to work!

**Thoughts:**
- Starting to see patterns. Realizing that fundamental concepts really are the same! (Similar to music)

### Day 29: January 27, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**:
- Spent the day learning about Python: syntax, Classes, Data Structures, Flow Control, etc

**Thoughts:**
- I love learning languages. Programming languages are no different. I can get used to this!

### Day 30: January 28, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**:
- Still trying to display data to the screen using Python. 
- Am able to display the list of IDs, but I need the data from those ID objects.
- Tried the challenge in Ruby, to get a feel for what needs to get done.

**Thoughts:**
- I will keep researching how to go about doing this!

### Day 31: January 29, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**:
- Learned how to return data in Python. A friend taught me some cool Python tricks!

### Day 34: February 1, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**:
- Applied to more jobs.
- Video interview with another job
- More Python: Command line arguments
