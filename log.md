# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
- I helped a group push their final project app onto Heroku (I am a TA at Wyncode Academy) 
- Working my way through Part 3 of this tutorial: https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/evil-front-part-3
- My goal is to finish this tutorial

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to focus on the tutorial, because of the students asking for help, but heroku-wise, we fixed an asset issue (make sure `font-size` has a dash in between! Heroku does not like CSS errors!), made sure the Gemfile only had 1 development block and 1 production block, and pushed successfully!

### Day 1: December 30, 2017, Saturday

** Today's Progress** :
- I worked on the `frontend-chat` tutorial and pushed to heroku successfully

**Thoughts:** Learned how Rails works with Webpacker

**Link to work:** [frontend-chat](https://frontend-chat.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 2: December 31, 2017, Sunday

** Today's Progress** :
- I finished the `frontend-chat` and also learned how to use static assets, as well as re-enable
Turbolinks, as well as get around not using Sprockets

**Thoughts:** I built a front end chat all with Rails!
