# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
- I helped a group push their final project app onto Heroku (I am a TA at Wyncode Academy) 
- Working my way through Part 3 of this tutorial: https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/evil-front-part-3
- My goal is to finish this tutorial

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to focus on the tutorial, because of the students asking for help, but heroku-wise, we fixed an asset issue (make sure `font-size` has a dash in between! Heroku does not like CSS errors!), made sure the Gemfile only had 1 development block and 1 production block, and pushed successfully!

### Day 1: December 30, 2017, Saturday

** Today's Progress** :
- I worked on the `frontend-chat` tutorial and pushed to heroku successfully

**Thoughts:** Learned how Rails works with Webpacker

**Link to work:** [frontend-chat](https://frontend-chat.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 2: December 31, 2017, Sunday

** Today's Progress** :
- I finished the `frontend-chat` and also learned how to use static assets, as well as re-enable
Turbolinks, as well as get around not using Sprockets

**Thoughts:** I built a front end chat all with Rails!

### Day 3: January 1, 2018, Monday

** Today's Progress** :
- Working my way through freeCodeCamp courses. Still on HTML5/CSS, but it's good to reinforce what I already know.

**Thoughts:** Today is more of a relaxing day for coding!

### Day 4: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Worked on more freeCodeCamp exercises.
- Nerded out over code with a few people.

**Thoughts:** It is good to keep reinforcing the skills I already know. However, new things keep sinking in as well!

### Day 5: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Learned about Services in Rails
- Answered technical questions for a potential job

**Thoughts:** Being unemployed is very scary, but learning more things keeps me going!

### Day 6: January 4, 2018, Thursday

** Today's Progress** :
- Finished answering technical questions with a potential employer
- Fixing bugs in a Rails app for another potential employer

**Thoughts:** Being able to complete these challenges confirms that I actually know some things and have improved, these past 2 years! What a good feeling!

### Day 7: January 5, 2018, Friday

** Today's Progress** :
- TAed at Wyncode and helped a student set up Rails on their new MacBook
- Helped another student model their data for an upcoming project
- Learned about GitLab Workhorse

**Thoughts:** Cohort 20 left me a "thank you" note for TAing their cohort. Very cool! 

### Day 8: January 6, 2018, Saturday

** Today's Progress** :
- Applied for more jobs
- More freeCodeCamp front end fun!

**Thoughts:** Even though I am always reading about code or programmers or programming, it is good to take a break from time to time. Balance is everything. That being said, I'm having a blast understanding front end better and better!!

### Day 9: January 7, 2018, Sunday

** Today's Progress** :
- Understanding how things tie in, better than before!
- Went through more freeCodeCamp exercises. Working through jQuery selectors.

**Thoughts:** When I started to learn all of this, over 2 years ago, I had to take extensive notes and really try to wrap my brain around it all. Now, it seems like second nature; it is purely reinforcing!! Yay!

### Day 10: January 8, 2018, Monday

** Today's Progress** :
- TAed at Wyncode. Helped a student push to production/Heroku
- Figured out that another student was deleting items from the database (had bad data)
- Taught a student the decent_exposure gem. 

**Thoughts:** The first student had operating system/Ruby Version issues. We resolved it by using rbenv.
