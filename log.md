# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**:
- I helped a group push their final project app onto Heroku (I am a TA at Wyncode Academy)
- Working my way through Part 3 of this tutorial: https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/evil-front-part-3
- My goal is to finish this tutorial

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to focus on the tutorial, because of the students asking for help, but heroku-wise, we fixed an asset issue (make sure `font-size` has a dash in between! Heroku does not like CSS errors!), made sure the Gemfile only had 1 development block and 1 production block, and pushed successfully!

### Day 1: December 30, 2017, Saturday

** Today's Progress** :
- I worked on the `frontend-chat` tutorial and pushed to heroku successfully

**Thoughts:** Learned how Rails works with Webpacker

**Link to work:** [frontend-chat](https://frontend-chat.herokuapp.com/)

### Day 2: December 31, 2017, Sunday

** Today's Progress** :
- I finished the `frontend-chat` and also learned how to use static assets, as well as re-enable
Turbolinks, as well as get around not using Sprockets

**Thoughts:** I built a front end chat all with Rails!

### Day 3: January 1, 2018, Monday

** Today's Progress** :
- Working my way through freeCodeCamp courses. Still on HTML5/CSS, but it's good to reinforce what I already know.

**Thoughts:** Today is more of a relaxing day for coding!

### Day 4: January 2, 2018, Tuesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Worked on more freeCodeCamp exercises.
- Nerded out over code with a few people.

**Thoughts:** It is good to keep reinforcing the skills I already know. However, new things keep sinking in as well!

### Day 5: January 3, 2018, Wednesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Learned about Services in Rails
- Answered technical questions for a potential job

**Thoughts:** Being unemployed is very scary, but learning more things keeps me going!

### Day 6: January 4, 2018, Thursday

** Today's Progress** :
- Finished answering technical questions with a potential employer
- Fixing bugs in a Rails app for another potential employer

**Thoughts:** Being able to complete these challenges confirms that I actually know some things and have improved, these past 2 years! What a good feeling!

### Day 7: January 5, 2018, Friday

** Today's Progress** :
- TAed at Wyncode and helped a student set up Rails on their new MacBook
- Helped another student model their data for an upcoming project

**Thoughts:** Cohort 20 left me a "thank you" note for TAing their cohort. Very cool!

### Day 8: January 6, 2018, Saturday

** Today's Progress** :
- Applied for more jobs
- More freeCodeCamp front end fun!

**Thoughts:** Even though I am always reading about code or programmers or programming, it is good to take a break from time to time. Balance is everything. That being said, I'm having a blast understanding front end better and better!!

### Day 9: January 7, 2018, Sunday

** Today's Progress** :
- Understanding how things tie in, better than before!
- Went through more freeCodeCamp exercises. Working through jQuery selectors.

**Thoughts:** When I started to learn all of this, over 2 years ago, I had to take extensive notes and really try to wrap my brain around it all. Now, it seems like second nature; it is purely reinforcing!! Yay!

### Day 10: January 8, 2018, Monday

** Today's Progress** :
- TAed at Wyncode. Helped a student push to production/Heroku
- Figured out that another student was deleting items from the database (had bad data)
- Taught a student the decent_exposure gem.

**Thoughts:** The first student had operating system/Ruby Version issues. We resolved it by using rbenv.

### Day 11: January 9, 2018, Tuesday

** Today's Progress** :
- Making my way through the freeCodeCamp jQuery lessons.

**Thoughts:** I remember, before attending Wyncode (over 2 years ago), learning about jQuery and understanding and liking it.

### Day 14: January 12, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress** :
- Successfully routed buttons in my moviesiveseen Rails project (personal project) and have all of the CRUD operations working. Need to style.

- Will TA at Wyncode for a few hours today!

**Thoughts:** It feels GOOD to be making some progress on this project.

### Day 15: January 13, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**:
- Worked on the personal project, adding image uploading and authorization!

### Day 16: January 14, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**:
- Working on image feature in movie Rails app

### Day 18: January 16, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Partially designed index page. It's looking so cool!!!
- Had a job interview with a screenshare - had to make tests pass (I did), and explain the code I changed and why (I felt like it went well)

### Day 19: January 17, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Let a breakout session at Wyncode about Classes and Methods

** Today's Progress**:
- Both the Welcome page and the Index page are responsive on all devices!
- Need to figure out image size on heroku (significantly smaller than on local)
- Had another interview (went well - will get coding challenge)

### Day 22: January 20, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**:
- Pretty much figured out the Rails side of things for this coding challenge.
- Trying to integrate React components to make this a SPA. Having trouble getting the framework to recognize the view/components (returning json, instead)

**Thoughts:** I am so close to finishing this challenge! It feels good that I'm "doing it". Once I figure out how to get the API to read the React components, I'll be in business.

### Day 23: January 21, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**:
- Figured out how to render my components in the DOM
- Wired in the Index, Show, Edit and Delete functions
- Edit, now, requires that all fields are filled in, or else it will save it as null. Need to fix that

**Thoughts:** I can not believe I am figuring all of this stuff out on my own!!! I hope I get a job offer soon!

### Day 24: January 22, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**:
- Successfully created all CRUD actions to the SPA/React front! I can DELETE a Post, CREATE a Post, EDIT, and view all of the active ones!

### Day 27: January 25, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**:

- Went on a walk and talk with Dunia (a python programmer from Cuba) and Michael (has a cs degree, but is doing support at the moment)
- Wrote my first Django database migration. This basically entails creating a method that adds what you'd like, and one to be able to remove. In the Migration class, the operations consist of running those 2 methods. I am trying to add an Accounts datastore to the Kaseya BMS integration, but it is currently not showing up in the datastores.
- SO exciting. Was able to figure out how to generate an access token into the kaseya API, and then make a GET request to return all of the Accounts data (which is what I am trying to add)

**Thoughts:**
- I am enjoying the culture at the job, especially the walk and talks!

### Day 87: March 29, 2918 Thursday

** Today's Progress**:
- The first thing I did was pull the latest from origin, so I had the most up-to-date code to work with (but worked off my branch)
- Goal is to get the Kaseya BMS Accounts Datastore to show, so I can then create the datasets
- Got the datastore to show up! I did this by cleaning up the migration (I had it doing much more than it needed to do), rerunning the migration, and then Brooke showed me how to confirm that the datastore was actually in the local db. I removed the datasource and re-added it. BOOM! Kaseya BMS Accounts was there! (New datastore is created)
- Next step is to filter for IsActive is true (in tasks code)
- Now, I need to build the API Dataset - Built the API dataset and dataset! Needed to set the datatypes for each field, based on the API docs
- Once there is a dataset, can then build a gauge
- Pushed code up for core (the migration) and tasks (the code that calls the 3rd party API and gets the data) and tested the sync with a real customer's data (locally)
- Merged my Core and Task PRs into dev and onboarded the Kaseya BMS datasource on QA. Made a PR from dev to production!

**Thoughts:**
- It was my "goal" to get the Kaseya BMS Accounts to show in the Datastores, before lunch. It's before 11am! Yay!
- I would've never been able to do things as quickly if I hadn't shadowed Brooke prior
- My teammates told me they gave me that task, and planned on it taking me 2 weeks. It only took me 2 days! :)

### Day 88: March 30, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**:
- Gained Super User access to the BrightGauge app (I will be able to create datasets in production)
- Built an API Dataset
- Distributed the dataset as default
- Added Accounts as a LEFT JOIN in the SQL for Ticket Statistics and Ticket Stats Lite
- Made a Pull Request in bg datasets (Randall approved it and merged it into Master)
- Copied another gauge and made a copy of it, in order to showcase this new field (Saved first/Created NEW)
- Made that gauge active and then distributed it (but did not distribute it to the one account that was diverged)

**Thoughts:**
- The better I am at something (in music or otherwise), the more comfortable I am to be myself and joke around. That's such a nice feeling :)
- Randall and Brooke explain things very well. I am lucky to be on this team, and think it's a good fit for me!!
- Very glad it is Friday, because I'm tired today and am having a little bit of trouble focusing.

### Day 89: March 31, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**:
- Day Off!

**Thoughts:**
- Yay!

### Day 90: April 1, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**:
- Day Off!

**Thoughts:**
- Yay!

### Day 91: April 2, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**:
- Had some trouble running my local environment in order to debug. Remembered that I needed to have vagrant up, so per the error message, I ran vagrant global-status, found the id, and ran vagrant up with that id. Restarted the tasks, server and web and it worked!
- Started a new task that included grabbing specific data (to grab an oncallMember, which is referenced through another endpoint)
- Updated and added connectwise on premise SQL in brightgauge-datasets repo (updated by making sure the SQL was yelling at us). Learned that we do not update datasets if they are custom (didn't need to do that)
- Wrote a task to add the 'service/boards' endpoint to the ConnectWise API. Waiting on credentials from a real customer in order to test this task.
- Read through ConnectWise developer docs
- Read more of Deep Work
- Read through Overview of Cycles, Current Cycle Announcement, Pitches, Cycle Planning and Team Organization In Cycle Workflow in preparation for Orly's "How we build software" tomorrow

**Thoughts:**
- Back to focusing! Horray for the weekend! :)

### Day 92: April 3, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Met with Orlando and Julie. He explained "How We Build Software"
- Read more Deep Work
- Had a Starbucks walk-and-talk with Randall and Kiki
- Had a parking lot walk-and-talk with Ashley and Jack

**Thoughts:**
- "Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed."
- "Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants"

### Day 93: April 4, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Worked through a view dataset with Randall, joining various tables in order to build a dataset that included expense data for a customer.
- Started the SQL course on Codecademy
- Developer's meetup in the PM (we discussed some interesting topics, including a Stack Overflow survey of developers, Data is Beautiful on Reddit, and the merits of Ruby over Python or vice versa)

**Thoughts:**
- I enjoyed learning some SQL at Wyncode, and am happy to dive deeper. It seems like a lot of people at BrightGauge know it! Another cool skill to have in my toolbox!
- Knowing Rails/Active Record helps immensely with SQL

### Day 94: April 5, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**:
- Went through more of the SQL course on Codecademy (and completed the course)
- Had a walk and talk with Jose and Sean (in the parking lot)
- Had a meeting with Kiki, who spoke about "How we ensure customer success", and explained more about the BrightGauge app and how it works (very helpful!)

**Thoughts:**
- Maybe because of the late night at work (with the meeting), or because I'm tired. Had a difficult time focusing today!

### Day 95: April 6, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**:
- Brooke gave me more SQL learning resources: sqlbolt.com

**Thoughts:**
- It's really cool that I will know one more programming language and hopefully be proficient in it (and then python as well!)
- Had a walk and talk with Nat and Derek
- Brian gave his history and values of BrightGauge talk (interesting!)

### Day 96: April 7, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**:
- Read some Deep Work (not much)
- Day off!

**Thoughts:**
- Resetting both mind and body

### Day 97: April 8, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**:
- Read a bit

**Thoughts:**
- Ready for the work week/refreshed!

### Day 98: April 9, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**:
- Wrote a task to pull in JournalEntry data from Quickbooks API
and a migration. Refactored the migration and am working on refactoring the task.
Having some difficulty with filtering
- Not quite sure how to test, yet
- Learned about timedelta in python
- Had my first Rambo meeting - very encouraging!

**Thoughts:**
- I am grateful I got into this company at this point in time! Timing is everything :)

### Day 99: April 10, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Refactored journalentry task for QuickBooks. Still getting authentication errors; not sure if the method, itself, works!
- Released a migration and task for JournalEntries into QA and Production. It bombed because I misnamed the task pathname in the migration. Fixed the bug, got another bug on an optional param. Ended up making that a param that is needed. All good. Released to QA, tested, released to prod, tested. Now, on to making the dataset!

**Thoughts:**
- It is somewhat difficult to verify if something works. I suspect if data is returned, then it "works"

### Day 100: April 11, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**:
- Learned more about API vs VIEW datasets
- Paired with Brooke on iterating through a list of objects in the returned data object. I know how I'd do it in Ruby, and it was really straightforward/made sense in Python as well!
- Worked on the view dataset (SQL). Currently joining in another table in order to display more information

**Thoughts:**
- I really like how explicit the Python language is!

### R2 Day 1: April 12, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**:
- Last night, I saw Valeri Karpov speak at Wyncode (inventor of the MEAN stack)
- Joined one table into another with SQL and tested (it worked!). Used aliases as well.
- Read more Deep Work. Received Competing with Luck, but won't start that until this one
is finished
- Did my first code review on GitHub...ever!
- Working my way through the sqlbolt.com interactive tutorial

**Thoughts:**
- Today was calm, but I feel like I got things done. The way it should be!

### R2 Day 2: April 13, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**:
- Built a gauge and saved as default (paired with someone who really knows how to do this well!)
- Starting on writing another task/migration for a different dataset! The more practice, the "easier" it will be when I start my own integration from start to finish!

**Thoughts:**
- I need to learn more about financial data in order to build more effective gauges for customers!
- I really like the sleuth aspect of this job; always figuring out these little puzzles

### R2 Day 3: April 14, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**
- I walked to Whole Foods and read more Deep Work - almost done!

**Thoughts:**
- The required reading not only applies to this new job, but to seeking a better quality of life! I really appreciate that!

### R2 Day 4: April 15, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**
- Read some Competing Against Luck by Clayton M. Christensen
- Joined Pythondev slack channel/community

**Thoughts:**
- Day off. Might work on Mom's app!

### R2 Day 5: April 16, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**
- Fixed a KeyError. One of the ids can always be found, but added a try/except to check for another version of id. If that wasn't found, it would default to an empty string. (using the .get method)
- Learned the difference between continue and pass in a function. Continue will break from the current iteration and go to the next one. Pass will keep going in the function.
- Finished Deep Work!
- Walked through filtering and params in a task

**Thoughts:**
- Learned more about try/except and the .get method in Python!
- "A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it's not a philosophical statement - it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done." - Deep Work

### R2 Day 6: April 17, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**
- Confirmed the basic workflow for adding data to the app.
- Read a bit of Competing With Luck (next book to finish)
- Randall showed me an edge case, full of complex SQL. It's fascinating to know what this querying language can do!

**Thoughts:**
- This book isn't as interesting, so far, as Deep Work, but I'll give it a chance! Both books are relevant to optimizing our lives as well as the product we're working on.

### R2 Day 7: April 18, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**
- Read some of Competing Against Luck by Clayton M. Cristensen
- Read through my integration for the next full cycle. Watched YouTube videos about the product I will be integrating, as well as read through docs (on Basecamp and product docs)
- Read about OAuth 2.0

**Thoughts:**
- Read a lot today!

### R2 Day 8: April 19, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**
- Squashed a bug by adding a default value/empty list, so the code does not try to iterate over "None"
- Made a gauge I built active and distributed it to clients who have that datasource/dataset!
- Getting more comfortable testing in the python shell
- I plan on going to a React Mobile Chat App Meetup tonight!

**Thoughts:**
- I do like python! I just wish I knew it better. Little by little!
- The React Native/Mobile Chat App meetup went very fast (I was able to follow along, but felt bad for those who couldn't! Not sure if I got much out of it, to be honest. A tutorial would've sufficed! It was fun to get the mobile chat app up and running, and use it via web sockets)

### R2 Day 9: April 20, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**
- Deployed my task and migration to QA and tested
- Was given access to the production environment! Deployed and migrated!

**Thoughts:**
- Feeling a bit more comfortable with the flow of grabbing data from a third party API and displaying it!
- Competing Against Luck reminds me of a Ted Talk I saw on YouTube about "Start with Why" by Simon Sinek. The author seems to think like an engineer when speaking about his Jobs Theory. Circumstances around this need for progress are essential! (Context is everything)

### R2 Day 10: April 21, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Day off

### R2 Day 11: April 22, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Day off

### R2 Day 12: April 23, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**
- Worked with Sketch and logos!
- Learned more about finding base URL info from third party APIs in documentation (to create access tokens, etc)
- Gulp was compiling my Haml code into HTML, but stripping out indentations. Figured out that I had more than one version of Haml, and the compiler was reading the latest. When I uninstalled that version, all was well with the world.

**Thoughts:**
- I learned a lot about initializing a datasource into our app

### R2 Day 13: April 24, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**
- Learned about authentication flow within our app and third party APIs

**Thoughts:**
- I am enjoying the process of getting to know the documentation and integrating this third party API into our app

### R2 Day 14: April 25, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**
- Went into the console of my computer and removed the SetUp files, because I needed to re-setup my computer with
my actual name, rather than my Mac Computer name being 'brightgauge'
- Local environment was borked

**Thoughts:**
- I enjoy devops, but simply don't know enough to feel confident!

### R2 Day 15: April 26, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**
- Local environment is working, thanks to Sean!
- Re-set up Sublime, git, bash profile settings, etc.
- Learned some dev ops (minimal/Cassandra)
- Experienced my first call on Slack (with a teammate)
- Had a GoToMeeting with a customer about the integration I am implementing

**Thoughts:**
- Sublime and iterm are optimal! Fixed my local database!
- I am glad that meetings are not the "normal thing", here. That being said, the
meeting went well.

### R2 Day 16: April 27, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**
- Write a method in Python that will build a URI based on the base and endpoints/
variables passed. Wrote it in a way that it will not matter the order of the
variables/endpoints being passed!
- Implementing pagination with third party API data calls

**Thoughts:**
- Doing my own integration from start to finish will be challenging, but I feel like I have
good people to help me, along the way (guidance!)

### R2 Day 17: April 28, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Day off

### R2 Day 18: April 29, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Day off

### R2 Day 19: April 30, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**
- Read up on inheritance in OOP/how it works with Python
- Trying to implement pagination. Understand the basic concept. Difficult to
implement with this 3rd party API, as the params for each endpoint are not
consistent
- Read the PEP8 StyleGuide for Python
- Learned what the word "frobnicate" means: The word “frobnicate” in IT is a
kind of techie slang that describes tweaking or fiddling with physical parts of
a technology. Frobnicate has been regularly abbreviated as “frob” or related to
a piece of hardware architecture called a “frobnitz.”
- Learned that if a line is too long in the code, it may be better to assign
a variable and pop that variable in that longer line

**Thoughts:**
- Learned that it's ok to work through getting stuck. And also to ask if a
piece of knowledge is missing!
- I found this interesting: Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and
spaces for indentation
- Learned from the PEP8 styleguide that CamelCase can also be called "StudlyCaps"

### R2 Day 20: May 1, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**
- Pair programming with team lead. Learned more about how Python "works" and how
to trace things back/reading errors.
- Got my first datasource up and running (very exciting!)
- Getting used to tracing things back/reading Python (and the structure of
our app)

**Thoughts:**
- My team lead explains things very well! It is nice to pair with someone who
can explain things from the ground up, code-wise.
- Today feels like a better day than yesterday, despite the fact that I did
learn a lot (more productive)

### R2 Day 21: May 2, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**
- Learning more and more about data, protecting data, GDPR, encryption
- Read about @property in Python. Learned that private variables do not exist
in Python. It is convention to write them with an underscore in front. Property
helps with backwards compatibility. You can modify a class and implement a
value constraint without changing too much of the code.
- property() is a built-in function that creates and returns a property object.
- Testing in python/shell
- Got something to work as expected. Great success! :)

**Thoughts:**
- In this day and age, it is smart to think about these things!
- Getting more used to testing in the python shell

### R2 Day 22: May 3, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**
- Read more of Competing Against Luck by Clayton M. Christensen
- Needed to rename a variable in order for the code to make more sense. Based
on the results, testing the UI, I knew to change it in all repos (I almost forgot
about the client-side, and when I didn't see my field anymore, I knew to change
it in that repo as well)

**Thoughts:**
- I can't get over how much I'm learning! And it never seems to stop, even on
"slower" days!
- Loving my Sublime setup

### R2 Day 23: May 4, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**
- Verbally went through my PRs with my team lead. Learned about where to set
variables in python (indentation matters!). Almost feels similar to JavaScript,
checking for the state/if a prop is available before it actually is.
- Fixed something wrong with the Sublime Jedi package I had installed. I could
not type an open parenths. Changed a line in the keymap settings. All good!
- Refactored and didn't break anything!

**Thoughts:**
- Refactoring makes sense WHY, but it's still icky to potentially break something
that works perfectly/without errors!

### R2 Day 24: May 5, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Relaxing!

### R2 Day 25: May 6, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off!

**Thoughts:**
- Same

### R2 Day 26: May 7, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**
- Deployed my code to the QA environment. Still need to figure out how to migrate/
read server logs in THAT environment. Could not test because of this blocker.
- Took down the app (in production) because of a missing closing brace. Installed flake8 in the
terminal to be overly-cautious (no such thing!). Know what to look for in the deployment logs, now.

**Thoughts:**
- Getting there!

### R2 Day 27: May 8, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**
- Deployed a bug fix to production (all went well!)
- Trying to get data to show, despite it "working". Probably need to do something in the code/iterate
or *something* in order to get it to show. That will fix a huge blocker!

**Thoughts:**
- I feel a bit stuck, but once I figure this out, things should get rolling, again!
- I "hope I'm doing it right"

### R2 Day 28: May 9, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**
- Brooke unblocked me! I *knew* I needed to do something with the data, because I saw a list of objects.
In order to return that data, it is necessary to iterate through the list in order to retrieve
each object! She opened my eyes to doing it in an efficient way.
- I wrote a complicated Python function that called another function, in order to retrieve a certain
id, and then grabbed all of those ids, popped them into a list, iterated through that list, and popped
each id into a GET request/url.

**Thoughts:**
- Even though yesterday was frustrating, it feels so good to be unblocked and carry on being
productive
- MUCH better day, coding-wise! It feels good to be able to try things out in the python console
and apply them in the actual code/context. I was able to do this in Ruby/Rails. Getting better
in this language!

### R2 Day 29: May 10, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**
- Added another endpoint. Understanding more and getting more efficient. "Travelling" in between
environments is still "scary", but I do tend to do things methodically and thoughtfully, for the most
part, so should eventually be very good/competent
- Trying to return all key/values from a json response, and iterate through arrays, if needed
- It seemed like everything was working. Now, I have a bunch of bugs. Authentication: refresh token
isn't triggering.

**Thoughts:**
- Tired today.

### R2 Day 30: May 11, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**
- Learned about overriding classes and methods (interface) in Python/Django
- Getting more familiar with how to debug using print statements
- Getting more familiar in the console
- Learned more about refreshing a token and fixed the refresh bug! Tested my code on the QA environment.

**Thoughts:**
- Much more "with it" today!

### R2 Day 31: May 12, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Day off

### R2 Day 32: May 13, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Day off

### R2 Day 33: May 14, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**
- Converting datetime to unicode in python (found out the requests library does that! I thought
I was being clever!)
- Re-read the docs and refactored the tasks to work exactly as expected.

**Thoughts:**
- Getting more used to working in the python console
- Nice to be able to take the time to do things *correctly*

### R2 Day 34: May 15, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**
- Released my code to QA, tested, and then released to Production and tested!
- Worked remotely (we have a mandatory/optional remote day!)
- Wrote some SQL/built out some datasets

**Thoughts:**
- I love having this option to work remotely. So far, the morning went well with the
releases! A few teammates were my "release buddies", so they watched the logs carefully,
and my team lead did the actual releases

### R2 Day 35: May 16, 2018 Wednesday

** Today's Progress**
- Back in the office!
- Writing SQL!
- Created datasets for my integration. Hope all of the data customers need is there!
- Read more Competing Against Luck

**Thoughts:**
- Tonight kicks off BrightGauge's Data Driven Workshop. Looking forward to seeing what it's all about!
- The big takeaway is that Jobs To Be Done is less product oriented and more process oriented.

### R2 Day 36: May 17, 2018 Thursday

** Today's Progress**
- Data Driven Workshop at BrightGauge Software!

**Thoughts:**
- It was awesome.

### R2 Day 37: May 18, 2018 Friday

** Today's Progress**
- Last day of the Data Driven Workshop. Most customers are coming in for private sessions
with support.
- Wrote a write-up from yesterday's workshop

**Thoughts:**
- Good quote from Competing Against Luck: "Customers don't want products, they want solutions
to their problems"
- A bit of a slow/unfocused day (I'm waiting on customers to get back to me)

### R2 Day 38: May 19, 2018 Saturday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Chillaxing

### R2 Day 39: May 20, 2018 Sunday

** Today's Progress**
- Day off

**Thoughts:**
- Day off

### R2 Day 40: May 21, 2018 Monday

** Today's Progress**
- Building gauges with real data. Learning about the data, intimately

**Thoughts:**
- I am nervous, and hope I can finish this integration on time. Baby steps
- By 4PM, I was playing with real data, building gauges, and even a nice-looking dashboard!

### R2 Day 41: May 22, 2018 Tuesday

** Today's Progress**
- Joined one table to another in a view dataset, but the fields weren't matching up.
Realized that I needed to use the LOWER() function in SQL to standardize the data (make all of the
characters of the string lowercase, so they'd match if the characters are the same!)
- Trying to implement pagination using a ContinuationToken. Read up on these/how they're used/how
to implement in Python. Rails has a gem called will_paginate which was very easy to use!

**Thoughts:**
- Yesterday and today were intense but good days! Learning a lot!
